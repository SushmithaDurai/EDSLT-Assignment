  -Assignment and prioritization of tasks.
  
  -Tracking urgent situations.
  
  -Monitoring damaged and repaired robots.
  
  -Organizing redeployment in a circular priority fashion.
  
  -Logging important mission events into the rescue log.


**Main Features:**

  -Add & View Tasks: **Queue** for normal missions, stack for urgent ones.
  
  -Urgent Task Handling: Move tasks from queue to **stack** and pop them with logs.
  
  -Rescue Log: **Logs** all significant events (task assignment, damage, repairs, etc.).
  
  -Robot Damage Management: Mark robots with damaged parts and later repair them using **SLL**.
  
  -Repaired Robots Tracking: Maintain and view a **DLL** of robots that are fixed.
  
  -Redeployment System: **Circular linked list** to rotate redeployment of fixed robots.
  
  -Interactive Console UI: **Menu-driven interface** using switch case, scanf and printf.
